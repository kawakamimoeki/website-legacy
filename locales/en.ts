  story:
    'I have been encouraged by technology. It has nurtured my creativity. Photography, music and software. Without computer technology, I would never have been able to actually put the ideas in my head into reality. It was a world where we could show our photos to many people without exhibition, and where we could make music without playing an instrument. The goal is to become an engineer who supports the creativity that is unique to the person.',
