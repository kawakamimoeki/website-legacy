    "description": "I have been saved by technology. However, it has not saved my life or solved my problems. It has nurtured my creativity. Photography, music and software. Without computer technology, I would never have been able to actually put the ideas in my head into reality. It was a world where we could show our photos to many people without exhibition, and where we could make music without playing an instrument. I want to give back to computer technology."
