In this article, we will consider together what a devops organization is and is not by looking at a simple question and how a "devops" organization responds to it.

### Q. What are some of the issue your organization or team has been facing lately?

In a devops organization, we are not bound by the best practices or definitions of any particular methodology, and we can face our own challenges.

_Example: the development team and the marketing team are not working together to provide optimal hospitality to users via ads. _

### Q. What have you changed recently in the way your organization or team works?

A devops organization tries to face challenges through trial and error. There is time for trial and error.

_Example: We recently set up a joint cross-functional meeting. _

### Q. Is there a place for members to share their failure/success stories with the organization?

Sharing stories can help to

- Increases transparency and builds trust within the team
- Colleagues can tell you how to prevent a damaging mistake before it is actually made
- More time available to solve new problems and encourage innovation.

_Example: Our development team has a meeting every morning to share what happened yesterday. _

### Q. Do one team and another use the same communication tools?

The fact that they use the same communication tools is a result of the two teams trying to communicate with each other. Two teams that do not communicate will not communicate just because they have Slack as a common tool.

_Example: The development team and the marketing team communicate through the same Slack channel and have a lively exchange of ideas. _

### Q. How many metrics do you have to measure your organization's success?

Insights into success.

_### e.g.) My organization measures conversion rates and the amount of user activity (PV, click events, etc.). We measure site latency. _

### Q. Is your organization's success measurement data publicly available?

If measurement data is publicly available, even employees without in-depth knowledge of operations (e.g., front-end engineers) can draw insights and decisions for iterative improvement.

_example) In my organization, Google Analytics data is publicly available to the development team, marketing team, stakeholders, and customers. However, outside of the development team, only some of the data is open to the public and does not lead to deeper insights. _

### Q. Are your organization's rules explicit?

Explicit rules allow new members to trace back the organization's past failures. Implicit rules are difficult for new members to notice and can lead to the same mistakes being repeated.

_Example: Our team's wiki summarizes how to do code reviews, what to check after deploying, etc. _
