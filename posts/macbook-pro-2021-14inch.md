I ordered MacBook Pro 14" (M1 Pro, 2021). This post explain the reason why I choice it. Let's go.

## My current machine

It is MacBook Air M1 8GB of RAM. I didn't use container environment and need more 8GB of RAM. I want to try M1 Mac's high speed swapping.

## Mac vs Linux, Windows

I love Apple's hardware. For example, trackpad, keyboard, camera, display and speeker of Macbook. So, I choice Mac. MacBook have all function of computer. ProMotion have 120Hz of refresh reate at most!

## MacBook Pro M1 Pro vs MacBook Air M2

I like MacBook Air's light weight body and long battery. But MacBook Air M2 doesn't have 32GB of RAM version. I verified how many RAM is used in work (Docker, Chrome and VSCode). The result is about 20GB. So I wanted buy a 32GB model to afford it.

## M1 Pro vs M1 Max

M1 Max is not required. Compared to the M1 Max competitor it is more expensive.
And the M1 Max power supply is 96W. It is too big for me.
