title: Will single-page sites become the standard?

Recently, I considered Astro indeed of Next.js as a blog implementation tool.

What I wanted to focus on most is UX. Which is a more comfortable way to browse pages?

Therefore, I verified their docs because the pages are implemented with their product.

- [Getting Started | Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started)
- [Getting Started ðŸš€ Astro Documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/)

The answer was very clear. I agree with Next.js docs, single page site. It's very comfortable. In Astro documentation, the first page load is quickly, but it is slowly when I click links. Next.js documentation is continuously light.

Finally, I decided that my blog is implemented with Next.js in the future. I made my decision based on my experience with the framework documentations. Will single-page sites become the standard? Or will the multi-page sites survive as a necessary and sufficient design?
