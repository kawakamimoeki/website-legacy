**From the Minimum Viable Product** recommendations, there is a clear benefit to starting with a small product.

> Since developing a product with many features based on faulty assumptions (value proposition) also increases the cost and risk of failure, it is comparatively cheaper to gain insights from the MVP and gradually incorporate them into product development.

[Minimum viable product - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)

**You only know what it is** when you build it. That means there is a lot to learn from a minimal product, not only for the customer, but for the developer as well.

Furthermore, I've been reading [Effective DevOps [Book]](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-devops/9781491926291/) recently, and here's a similar story in the context of changing organizations.

> Fixed thinking at the organizational level often occurs because there are multiple people who have bad memories of reform or are risk averse for various reasons.... It can be as small as correcting a wrong document... And it builds confidence that the change or reform will not only improve the situation, but will not necessarily cause major problems or service failures.

Yes... **Try small first to see what the team reform looks like, get feedback**. I'm with you. You can kind of imagine that suddenly expanding the big picture will result in team members becoming more skeptical of the new system. (**Is that really okay? Can you do it? **)

I have experienced this myself in my own recent work. I have felt the challenge that **teams tend** to think about measures based on how the creator wants the user to act, rather than how the user wants to act. So I put together a document talking about how the current issue is this, and measuring usability in this way. But the result was that **I myself wondered if this was really going to solve things? I began to have doubts about this**. I think this is due to the fact that I am afraid of the risk of changing the structure of the team.

#### What should we do?

Hmmm. What should I do in this case? I thought I would start tomorrow's meeting by proposing a policy based on how I want users to act. If that idea works, it would be easier to come up with the next measure based on a similar concept.

Around this point, I realized that \*\*starting small in size may be applicable to the way we work. I realized that it was a good idea. So I made up my own rules.

1. start from yourself
2. Start with your area of work
3. Start with a simple product
4. start from where you can get immediate feedback

That's all.
