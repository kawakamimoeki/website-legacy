      <p>
      Technology has fostered my creativity. Photos, music, software. Without computer technology, I would not have been able to make the ideas in my head a reality. It is a world where I can show photos to many people without an exhibition, and a world where I can make music without playing an instrument. My goal is to become an engineer who supports individual creativity.
