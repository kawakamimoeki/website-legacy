        I have been encouraged by technology. It has nurtured my creativity.
        Photography, music and software. Without computer technology, I would
        never have been able to actually put the ideas in my head into reality.
        It was a world where we could show our photos to many people without
        exhibition, and where we could make music without playing an instrument.
